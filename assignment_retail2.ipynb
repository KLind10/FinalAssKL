        "We've seen that the pattern for revenue is quite different for clothing stores and mail order companies. In other words: their revenues don't move up or down together. A way to make this observation more specific is to compute the **correlation coefficient**. It is a number between $-1$ and $1$ that describes the relation between two *random variables*. Here is how it works applied to our revenue numbers:\n",
        "\n",
        "- If the correlation coefficient for the revenue of two branches of the retail sector is $1$, their revenue is *positively correlated*. This means that when the revenue of branch A goes up, the revenue of branch B also goes up. In other words: the revenues for both branches go up together.\n",
        "- If the correlation coefficient is $-1$, the revenues of the two branches are *negatively correlated*. This means that if A's revenue goes up, B's revenue goes down. Similarly, if B's revenue goes up, A's revenue goes down. They move in the exact opposite direction.\n",
